## Description
Investron is a digital stock-picking assistant that scans the market each day to find the best stocks to buy and sell. It uses a model called LSTM, which can recognize patterns in past prices to predict which stocks are likely to rise. Investron checks specific indicators like MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Fibonacci levels for clues on market behavior. Based on these, it buys the two stocks it thinks are likely to go up the most and sells anything it's holding to free up funds. Running on a mock investment of 100,000 rupees over two years, it ended up with a total of about 158,000 rupees, showing a solid gain without using real money.
